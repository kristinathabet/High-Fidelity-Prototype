 # DH110 Assignment 6:High-Fidelity-Prototype by Kristina Thabet
 ## Project Description
### Summary 
The following high fidelity prototype was created to illustrate the process of navigating the New York DMV website to complete two different tasks: Finding information about changing your name on your drivers license and finding older driver resources.  
### Process 
The prototype was created using Figma, a browser generally used for prototyping and wireframing. I have used Figma in the past to create simple visualizations and wireframes for past projects. I began by conducting a low-fidelity prototype and testing it with a participant to see where my design is flawed or unclear. I then utilized Figma to digitize my paper wireframes created in the low- fidelity prototype in order to add clear, graphic and visual components to my wireframe, finally making it all flow together.
### Purpose
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to have a clear visualization of the proposed tasks users will complete and to ensure the interaction flow of the wireframes is logical and clear for the user. It is also a way to analyze if the graphic and visual components of the app are compatible with the information presented. This prototype is designed to be tested by prospective users before spending large sums of money developing the app. 

## Tasks the Interactive Prototype Supports
1. Users can find ample information about changing their name on their license. The prototype provides options for both completing this change in person as well as through mail. It also provides complete steps to this process for both Standard Licenses and Real IDs (the process is different for each option) as well as provides all the necessary paperwork to download.

2. Users can find different old driver resources including driver license restrictions for medical conditions, adjustments you can make to stay safe, assessment of driving skills, and ways to improve driving skills. This is important in order to minimize the amount odf danger that driving poses.

 # DH110 Assignment 6:High-Fidelity-Prototype by Kristina Thabet
 ## Project Description
### Summary 
The following high fidelity prototype was created to illustrate the process of navigating the New York DMV website to complete two different tasks: Finding information about changing your name on your drivers license and finding older driver resources.  
### Process 
The prototype was created using Figma, a browser generally used for prototyping and wireframing. I have used Figma in the past to create simple visualizations and wireframes for past projects. I began by conducting a low-fidelity prototype and testing it with a participant to see where my design is flawed or unclear. I then utilized Figma to digitize my paper wireframes created in the low- fidelity prototype in order to add clear, graphic and visual components to my wireframe, finally making it all flow together.
### Purpose
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to have a clear visualization of the proposed tasks users will complete and to ensure the interaction flow of the wireframes is logical and clear for the user. It is also a way to analyze if the graphic and visual components of the app are compatible with the information presented. This prototype is designed to be tested by prospective users before spending large sums of money developing the app. 

## Tasks the Interactive Prototype Supports
1. Users can find ample information about changing their name on their license. The prototype provides options for both completing this change in person as well as through mail. It also provides complete steps to this process for both Standard Licenses and Real IDs (the process is different for each option) as well as provides all the necessary paperwork to download.

2. Users can find different old driver resources including driver license restrictions for medical conditions, adjustments you can make to stay safe, assessment of driving skills, and ways to improve driving skills. This is important in order to minimize the amount odf danger that driving poses. 

## Initial Prototype before evaluating with others

This is a previous version of my prototype that I created before evaluating the design with my peers. After conversation about my prototype, I decided to make my button features look more dynamic by adding borders and shadow features to them. It was also suggested that I leave a margin around each of my frames to ensure words are not close to being cut out. I accepted this suggestion and also used grid lines to make sure everything in my protoype is consistent.

## Interactive Prototype
The high-fidelity interactive prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/FEB6cMg8eHllFAcfA8dpFq/Untitled?node-id=3%3A4&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A4)

## Cognitive Walkthrough
Video Evidence of Cognitive Walkthrough found [here](https://youtu.be/4NeQ-W-P4mg)

The cognitive walkthrough went quite smoothly and as expected. The user was able to navigate through the tasks easily and could redirect herself to the home page once she hit a frame with no forward movements. She noted that the colors were very visually pleasing and everything was easy to read. The user was not aware that not all the tasks on the website are functioning, so she was slighlty confused at the start of the cognitve walkthrough. As soon as she began clicking on inactive buttons on the prototype, the active tabs flashed color, informing her of where she should click next. Moving forward, I would make the search bar on my prototype interactive, having it lead to commonly searched questions and their answers. The user also suggestes that I add a home button and back button that is more intuitive then I have now. I will write under each button "home" or "back" very small so users can see both the icon and written words. Overall, this walkthrough was important in validating the functionality of my high-fidelity prototype and making sure there are no systematic errors in the wireflow.
